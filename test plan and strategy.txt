========================

1)ASSESS TESTABILITY:
==================
    --> Operability   	  :4
    --> Cntrollability	  :5
    --> Observability	  :5
    --> Simplicity	  :3
    --> Undestandability  :5
    --> Suitabilty	  :5
    --> Stability	  :5

2)TEST FACTORS: 
==============
     * Authorization	       :- Integration Testing
     * Correctness	       :- Integration Testing
     * Access control	       :- System testing
     * Reliabilty	       :- uat
     * Performance	       :- system testing
     * Integrity	       :- system testing
     * Continuity of processing:-  post UAT


3)ASSESS DRIVERS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE TESTING/APPROACH:-
================================================

      --> Authorization --->Integration testing --->tester(Quality analyst)/validation/blackbox
      --> Correctness ---> Integration testing --->tester/validation/blackbox/dynamic
      --> Access control ---> system testing --->tester/verification/blackbox
      --> Reliabilty ---> to what extent we trust ---> uat(client/customer)
      --> performance ---> system ---> tester
      --> integrity ---> system testing ---> tester
      --> continuity of processing ---> post UAT---> client



TEST PLAN:
=========

   1)Test item:- Application name
   2)Software risk issues:- Security,performance
   3)Features to be tested(user stories):- Register users,manager and member function,Admin Funtions
   4)Features not to be tested:- new version(which is not a scope)
   5)Approach:- Whitebox,  blackbox(It contains code and UI)
   6)Test deliverables:- source code,Test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report
   7)Item pass/fail criteria:- If i find 5 minor bugs,1 major bug,with no critical/shoew stopper in this case (pass)
   8)Suspension&resumption criteria:- Show stooper in application/non-availabilty of resouce/when this is resolved
   9)Responsibility:- project manager,TEST LEAD,TESTER,CUSTOMER
   10)Staffing and testing needs:- Testing needs
   11)Schedule:- 2 weeks
